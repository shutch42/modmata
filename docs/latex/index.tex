Modmata is a combination of two communication libraries. It is inspired by Firmata\textquotesingle{}s methods of communicating between a computer client and arduino server, but it uses Modbus communication rather than MIDI/\+Sysex messages. Modbus communication is sourced from the modbus-\/arduino library.\hypertarget{index_Applications}{}\doxysection{Applications}\label{index_Applications}
The project was originally meant to be an easy way for programming IO in the C programming language on Latte\+Panda, but it will work on any computer connected to an Arduino Leonardo. Just load the Standard\+Modmata file onto your arduino, and then connect it to a computer over USB. Then, programming of basic arduino commands can be done using the ModmataC library.

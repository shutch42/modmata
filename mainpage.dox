@section Introduction
Modmata is a combination of two communication libraries. It is inspired by Firmata's methods of communicating between a computer client and arduino server, but it uses Modbus communication rather than MIDI/Sysex messages. Modbus communication is sourced from the modbus-arduino library.

@section Applications
The project was originally meant to be an easy way for programming IO in the C programming language on LattePanda, but it will work on any computer connected to an Arduino Leonardo. Just load the StandardModmata file onto your arduino, and then connect it to a computer over USB. Then, programming of basic arduino commands can be done using the ModmataC library.
